# Getting and cleaning data - Course project

## 1- Raw data
Data have been collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone.\
* The initial description of the data can be found here (http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones).
* The data has been downloaded from: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

## 2- Data modifications
The R script called run_analysis.R does the following:
  1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
  2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
  3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
  4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
  5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

## 3- Code book
The following two variables have been added to the other variables in the final file (data_sumamry.txt)
  * SubjectID: the ID of each subject
  * Activity ID: the ID of the activity
All other variables are the same as in the initial dataset
